# Base datasets

For a few datasets that FsDet natively supports,
the datasets are assumed to exist in a directory called
"datasets/", under the directory where you launch the program.
They need to have the following directory structure:

## Expected dataset structure for Pascal VOC/DIOR/NWPU VHR-10:
```
VOC20{07,12}/
  Annotations/
  ImageSets/
  JPEGImages/
```


# Few-shot datasets

For each dataset, we additionally create few-shot versions by sampling shots for each novel category. For better comparisons, we sample multiple groups of training shots in addition to the ones provided in previous works. We include the sampling scripts we used for better reproducibility and extensibility. They should have the following directory structure:

## Pascal VOC:
```
vocsplit/
  box_{1,2,3,5,10}shot_{category}_train.txt
  seed{1-29}/
    # shots
```

Each file contains the images for _K_ shots for a specific category. There may be more instances in the images than _K_; in these cases, we randomly sample _K_ instances.

The shots in the `vocsplit` directory are the same shots used by previous works. We additionally sample 29 more groups of shots for a total of 30 groups, which can be generated by using [prepare_voc_few_shot.py](prepare_voc_few_shot.py).

See [prepare_voc_few_shot.py](prepare_voc_few_shot.py) for generating the seeds yourself.

In the config files, you have to specify the datasets to use. See our provided config files for more usage details. Below, we list out the names of the datasets and the data they correspond to:
```
voc_20{07,12}_trainval_{base,all}{1,2,3}        # Train/val datasets with base categories or all
                                                  categories for splits 1, 2, and 3.
voc_2007_trainval_all{1,2,3}_{1,2,3,5,10}shot   # Balanced subsets for splits 1, 2, and 3 containing
                                                  1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 shots for each category. You only
                                                  need to specify 2007, as it will load in both 2007
                                                  and 2012 automatically.
voc_2007_trainval_novel{1,2,3}_{1,2,3,5,10}shot # Same as previous datasets, but only contains data
                                                  of novel categories.
voc_2007_test_{base,novel,all}{1,2,3}           # Test datasets with base categories, novel categories,
                                                  or all categories for splits 1, 2, and 3.
```
